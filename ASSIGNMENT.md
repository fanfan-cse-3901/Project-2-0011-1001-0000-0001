# Project 2: The Game of Set

SEE THE COMPLETE ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION ON THE COURSE WEB PAGE. This is only a summary!

Your team must meet and choose four project manager's for this assignment. The project managers roles are:

* The overall project manager will coordinate and check quality for the entire project.
* The implementation project manager will coordinate and check quality for the coding tasks.
* The documentation project manager will coordinate and check quality for documenting code.
* The testing project manager will coordinate and check quality for testing code.

All team members must participate when deciding on which four different team members to assign to the roles. Though, the team member who plays the role of the overall project manager must be a team member who already has the most experience with the Ruby language.

The responsibility of a manager is to oversee and help coordinate work accomplished by the group. A project manager must participate in the implementation of the project as well as perform managerial tasks.

The role of a manager is **_NOT_** to tell anyone what to do or boss anyone around. Team members are **_NOT_** to dump work on a manager or assume that a manager will do their work for them, especially if you have procrastinated or have not studied the course material well. You as a team member are responsible for the work you take on and to report to **_ALL_** other team members on the progress and quality of your work.

## Individual Assignment

**BEFORE** starting the group portion of the project **_EACH_** team member must individually accomplish the following:

* Thoroughly study the lecture notes on Git and Ruby
* Accomplish any tutorials and related reading material indicated in the _[Resources](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~shareef.1/3901.su18/resources/)_ section of the course website
* Also, look over the reading material in the "Software Engineering" portion of the Resources section of the course website

**_Important Note:_** A team member who is ill prepared before starting the group portion of this assignment because s/he has not sufficiently accomplished the individual portion of the assignment above cannot use this as an excuse for that team member to contribute less work on the project. Those team members who are ill prepared **_MUST_** put in more time and effort than other team members to prepare in order to be able to contribute **_EQUALLY_** with all other team members. In addition, those team members that are well prepared **_MUST_** work to help those that need to catch up with the material.

It is the responsibility of **_EVERY_** team member to ensure that each team member contributed equally to the final solution submitted to the graders.

Your project will be graded not only on your group's solution but also on how well your group worked together to arrive at your final solution. An imbalance of the work load will result in a lower grade for the project regardless of the quality of the solution.

## Group Assignment

* Your team must meet face-to-face each week with all team members present on the agreed upon day and time your team members indicated to me in your Project #1 submission.
* Your team should have additional face-to-face meetings. You should also determine additional channels of communication with team members since you will need to integrate your work with others.
* Your team should plan and allocate time to integrate your work well before the deadline. I suggest that the team work with the overall project manager to set team deadlines early so that all team members know the status of everyone's work. Create a schedule that all team members can agree to adhere to and work to achieve towards.
* Use your team's private repository on GitHub to help manage the development of your team's solution. We will provide this private repository for your team in our GitHub organization called cse3901-osu-2018su.

### Problem: The Game of Set

"Set" is a card game in which players attempt to find a group of cards that satisfy a particular criterion. It is a speed game: 12 cards are dealt face-up, and the players try to be the first to make a set from the visible cards. For a complete description of the game see the Wikipedia [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28game%29).

Implement this game in Ruby. Your game can be text-based (i.e., using the console). The basic, required, functionality of your game is to deal the appropriate number of cards, verify the correctness of player-identified sets, replace the identified cards with new ones, and keep track of score to identify a winner.

Optional functionality is anything that makes the game more interesting and enjoyable to play. Some examples of such functionality are:

* A graphical front-end. A visual representation of the cards makes it easier for most people to identify sets and gives your game a more polished appearance.
* A timer. Racing against the clock could be appealing to some players.
* A hint generator. When players are stumped, some encouragement can be useful. Good hints require some sophistication though. For example, the dealer could announce how many different sets are available in the cards, or identify a single card that is involved in some number of sets.
* A computer player. A computer player can contribute to the game in various ways.
* Statistics. With a computer player to identify sets, one can run many (thousands of) games to empirically measure (through simulation) interesting statistics. For example, how often does a set not occur in the standard number of cards? How does this probability change with different numbers of cards turned up?
* Modes or levels. Competitive or collaborative versions are possible, or different levels of difficulty.

This is not an exhaustive list of possibilities. Feel free to add whatever functionality would make your game the most interesting for people to actually play.

See the course web page for a detailed description of the assignment including grading guidelines and submission.
